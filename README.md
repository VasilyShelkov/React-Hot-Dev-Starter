# React-Hot-Dev-Starter-Kit


##Introduction
A skeleton project for starting with a hot-loading development server to get going straight away...

Entry is index.js which uses [react router 4.0](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v4) with a single fake route.

##So Many Starter-Kits already available for React so why ?!
Well, there's plenty of hot-loading starter kits already out there, to be honest, I'm only creating another one because I found the ones that are out there are either outdated, or bloated with a lot of stuff I don't want.

##What It Includes:
- [Webpack 2.0](https://webpack.js.org/) dev and prod config in the webpack folder [transforming jsx babel es6](https://babeljs.io/) to javascript. In prod it the bundles can be found in the dist folder

- [React-hot-loader 3](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/next) which uses the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server)

- Testing using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). To run tests ```npm test```

- airbnb [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) settings which I highly recommend using with yuour favourite text editor's eslint plugin ! (tried and tested in Atom, Sublime and my preferred Vim :D)

- An [express](http://expressjs.com/) server for production
